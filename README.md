# orpcrack-cli
**Ophcrack CLI** is a password recovery tool that uses rainbow tables to crack Windows password hashes. It is particularly effective for recovering passwords from Windows XP, Vista, and 7 systems.

### Installation

Ophcrack is typically pre-installed on Kali Linux. You can check if it's installed by running:

```bash
ophcrack-cli --version
```

If it's not installed, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install ophcrack
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Prepare the Hashes**

   To use Ophcrack, you need to extract password hashes from the target system. This can be done using tools like `pwdump` or `samdump2`. For example, after extracting the hashes, save them in a file named `hashes.txt`.

   Example content of `hashes.txt`:

   ```
   user1:500:abc123456:...
   user2:501:xyz789012:...
   ```

2. **Run Ophcrack**

   Use the following command to start cracking the hashes:

   ```bash
   ophcrack-cli hashes.txt
   ```

3. **Output Example**

   After running the command, you may see output similar to this:

   ```
   Cracking user1's password...
   user1:password123
   user2:letmein
   ```

### Additional Options

- **Specify a Rainbow Table**

  You can specify a custom rainbow table with the `-r` option. For example:

  ```bash
  ophcrack-cli -r /path/to/rainbow/table hashes.txt
  ```

- **Show Help and Options**

  To see all available options and commands, use:

  ```bash
  ophcrack-cli --help
  ```

### Conclusion

Ophcrack CLI is a powerful tool for recovering Windows passwords using rainbow tables. Always ensure you have permission to test any passwords or systems, and use it responsibly within legal boundaries.

Understood. Here's how you can use the ophcrack-cli tool on Kali Linux:

**About ophcrack-cli**
ophcrack-cli is a command-line version of the ophcrack password cracking tool. It is designed to recover Windows passwords using rainbow tables.

**Installation**
ophcrack-cli is typically pre-installed on Kali Linux. You can verify its installation by running:

```
which ophcrack-cli
```

If it's not installed, you can install it using:

```
sudo apt-get install ophcrack-cli
```

**Basic Usage**
The basic syntax for using ophcrack-cli is:

```
ophcrack-cli [options] <input_file>
```

Here are some common options:

- `-t <tables>`: Specifies the rainbow table to use (e.g., -t vista_free)
- `-l <language>`: Sets the language for the output (e.g., -l en)
- `-o <output_file>`: Writes the cracked passwords to an output file

**Example: Cracking Windows Password Hashes**
Assume you have a file named `hashes.txt` that contains Windows password hashes, one per line. You can use ophcrack-cli to crack these hashes as follows:

```
ophcrack-cli -t vista_free -l en -o cracked_passwords.txt hashes.txt
```

This command will:
- Use the "vista_free" rainbow tables to crack the passwords
- Set the output language to English
- Write the cracked passwords to a file named "cracked_passwords.txt"

**Example Output**
The output of the ophcrack-cli command might look something like this:

```
ophcrack version 3.8.0, (c) 2008-2019 Objectif Securite
Loading tables...
Cracking hashes...
user1:password123
user2:letmein
user3:123456
```

This shows that ophcrack-cli was able to crack the password hashes for the users "user1", "user2", and "user3".

**Important Considerations**
- Always ensure you have permission to use ophcrack-cli on any system you're testing.
- Rainbow tables can be large, so make sure you have enough storage space to accommodate them.
- ophcrack-cli is a powerful tool, so use it responsibly and ethically.



                              ALTERNATIVE
Ophcrack-cli is a command-line version of the Ophcrack password cracking tool, which is available on Kali Linux. Here's a brief overview of how to use it and some examples:

**Basic Syntax:**
```
ophcrack-cli [options] <hash_file>
```
**Options:**

* `-t`: specifies the type of hash (e.g., LM, NTLM, MD5, etc.)
* `-d`: specifies the dictionary file to use for cracking
* `-n`: specifies the number of threads to use for cracking
* `-v`: enables verbose mode

**Examples:**

1. **Cracking a single LM hash:**
```
ophcrack-cli -t lm hash.txt
```
Assuming `hash.txt` contains a single LM hash, Ophcrack-cli will try to crack it using its default settings.

Output:
```
Loaded 1 password hash (LM)
Cracked password: mypassword
```
2. **Cracking multiple NTLM hashes with a dictionary:**
```
ophcrack-cli -t ntlm -d /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hashes.txt
```
Assuming `hashes.txt` contains multiple NTLM hashes, one per line, Ophcrack-cli will try to crack each hash using the words in the `rockyou.txt` dictionary file.

Output:
```
Loaded 5 password hashes (NTLM)
Cracked password: user1:password1
Cracked password: user2:password2
...
```
3. **Cracking a MD5 hash with a brute-force attack:**
```
ophcrack-cli -t md5 -n 4 hash.txt
```
Assuming `hash.txt` contains a single MD5 hash, Ophcrack-cli will try to crack it using a brute-force attack with 4 threads.

Output:
```
Loaded 1 password hash (MD5)
Cracked password: mypassword
```
**Important Note:** Ophcrack-cli should be used ethically and legally, with proper authorization and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

Ophcrack is a Windows password cracker that uses rainbow tables to crack passwords. Here's how to use the command-line interface (`ophcrack-cli`) on Kali Linux:

**1. What Ophcrack Does**

*   It's a tool for recovering Windows passwords by cracking password hashes.
*   It utilizes pre-computed tables (rainbow tables) to speed up the cracking process.
*   Ophcrack works for Windows NT/2000/XP/Vista/7.

**2. Installation**

   If you have the `ophcrack-cli` package installed, you can use the command line interface. Note that if you install the `ophcrack` package, it comes with a graphical interface, but can also be used from the command line.

**3. Basic Usage**

   *   Ophcrack can be used with command line using the options below, or can be run as a pure graphical software.

**4. How to Use**

1.  **Obtain Windows Password Hashes:**

    *   Ophcrack needs the password hashes from the target Windows system. These are stored in the SAM (Security Account Manager) file.
    *   You'll also need the SYSTEM file from the Windows system32/config directory.
    *   To access the SAM, the Windows partition must not be running.
    *   You can extract these files by booting into Kali Linux from a USB or Live CD in forensic mode.
    *   Once booted into Kali, navigate to the Windows partition and copy the SAM and SYSTEM files to a location accessible within Kali.

2.  **Load Hashes into Ophcrack:**

    *   You can load the hashes into Ophcrack using the GUI.

3.  **Download Rainbow Tables:**

    *   Download the rainbow tables from the official website.

4.  **Crack the Passwords:**

    *   In the Ophcrack GUI, load the PWDUMP file.
    *   Click "Crack" to start the password recovery process.

**5. Example**

1.  **Boot into Kali Linux** from a live USB.
2.  **Mount the Windows partition** if it's not automatically mounted.
3.  **Navigate to the Windows SAM and SYSTEM files:**  These are typically located in `/mnt/hda1/WINDOWS/system32/config/`.
4.  **Copy the SAM and SYSTEM files** to your Kali desktop.
5.  **Create a Hash File:** Use a tool like `pwdump` or `samdump2` to extract the hashes from the SAM file.
6.  **Load the Hash File:** In Ophcrack GUI, load the hash file you created.
7.  **Load Rainbow Tables:** Download and add rainbow tables in Ophcrack.
8.  **Crack:** Start the cracking process.

**6. Important Considerations**

*   **Rainbow Tables:**  Ophcrack relies on rainbow tables.  You'll need to download the appropriate tables for the Windows version and the types of passwords you expect to find.  Smaller, free tables are available, but larger, paid tables offer a higher success rate.
*   **LM and NTLM Hashes:** Ophcrack primarily targets LAN Manager (LM) and NT LAN Manager (NTLM) hashes.
*   **Graphical Interface:**  While `ophcrack-cli` implies a command-line interface, much of the documentation refers to using the GUI.
*   **Older Windows Versions:** Ophcrack is most effective on older Windows versions (XP, Vista, 7) due to the weaker hashing algorithms used.
